=================================

By Philip M. Hubbard, 2013


Overview
--------

Digraph is a Java library that implements directed graphs.  It has some functionality for processing directed graphs with map-reduce algorithms in Hadoop.  While Digraph has some general capabilities, it was specifically designed to support the Sabe library, for experiments in genome sequence assembly by Euler tours.
